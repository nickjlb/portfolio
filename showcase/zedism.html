          <p class="block">I was tasked with developing a site for my former mentor
          at Ego ID Media in San Diego. His
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080609231520/http://www.zedism.com/" target="_blank">original website</a> had been created in the early 2000s
          was still functional, but not particularly responsive or modern. Because he is an artist,
          he wanted the new site to act as a showcase, rather than just a basic set of landing pages.</p>

          <div class="image-with-cap">
            <img class="cap-image" src="../images/oldzedism.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="image-cap">The original landing page.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="block">We decided to use WordPress as the CMS for the new site.
          As the project intern, I began the search for a theme that would display
          his art in the most visual way possible, and after several rounds of vetting,
          we decided on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wpzoom.com/themes/inspiro/">current theme</a>. It included a rotating gallery that fills
          the screen, diplaying his art front and center. After this, the site required
          significant customization to tailor it to my mentor's liking.</p>
