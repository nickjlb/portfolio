          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p class="block">I'm Nicholas Banning, an alumnus of the University of California, Irvine.
          I majored in Criminology, with a minor in Philosophy,
          and I have a penchant for the tech field. Those interests fostered the growth of my
          technical abilities and social awareness.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="block">For some of my work, I've developed
            <a href="https://nickjlb.itch.io/" target="_blank">video games</a>,
            created <a href="https://zedism.com/" target="_blank">websites</a>,
          repaired hardware, helped others troubleshoot technical issues, and crafted
          logos and social media posts.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="block">My <em>best work</em> arises when problem solving.
          Many of the projects above involved analysis,
          obstacles, testing, and failures to arrive at the right solution.
          My greatest strength is my sheer tenacity to find solutions,
          which means I embrace failure, not as a necessary evil, but as the most
          important part of finding a solution.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="block highlight">I strongly believe failure is necessary
          to solve any difficult issue. My ability to recognize failure's value
          and learn swiftly from it is key.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="block">This passion extends to both technical work and
          broader social issues and incentives. I've written hundreds of pages
          of work that attempt to problem solve major, difficult issues within
          our society, and I thrive at doing so.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="block">I'm self-driven and motivated by my own desire to solve
          both minor and major issues, and most of my skills I've attained out of
          a personal drive to do so. I also have excellent customer
          service skills and it's my mission to exercise patience and empathy with
          all that I meet. If that sounds like a welcome addition to your team,
          reach out below!</p>
